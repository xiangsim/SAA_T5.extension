    Autosave the document after a set interval. The feature runs in
    the background and will activate when switching between views to 
    minimize interruption. A bar will appear at the top of the Revit
    window to indicate the document is saving. Note that undo history
    is lost after document saves: do not activate this tool if this
    is important to your workflows. If Revit stops unexpectedly while
    working in a central model, either open the local model directly 
    and sync, or open the model from the cloud and select Keep my
    changes and open the model when prompted. This tool does not
    replace the synchronize tool or native Revit sync.
